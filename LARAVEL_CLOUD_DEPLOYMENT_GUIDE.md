## üèÅ Before You Start - Local Testing

### Step 1: Verify Your Local Setup Works

Before deploying, make sure everything works locally:

```bash
# 1. Install PHP dependencies
composer install

# 2. Install JavaScript dependencies
npm install

# 3. Copy environment file (if not already done)
cp .env.example .env

# 4. Generate application key
php artisan key:generate

# 5. Create database file (for local SQLite)
touch database/database.sqlite

# 6. Run migrations
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed

# 7. Create storage link
php artisan storage:link

# 8. Build frontend assets
npm run build

# 9. Test the application
php artisan serve
```

‚úÖ **Check**: Visit `http://localhost:8000` and verify:
- Homepage loads
- Blog page works
- Admin panel accessible at `/admin`
- Images display correctly

If everything works locally, proceed to deployment!

## üì¶ GitHub Preparation

### Step 2: Prepare Your Repository

1. **Check your Git status**:
```bash
git status
```

2. **Make sure .env is NOT tracked** (it should be in .gitignore):
```bash
# This should return nothing or say "not found"
git ls-files .env
```

3. **Commit all your latest changes**:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Prepare for Laravel Cloud deployment"
```

4. **Push to GitHub**:
```bash
git push origin main
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Make sure your repository is PUBLIC or you have given Laravel Cloud access to private repos.
